# dokku-weasyprint

dokku-weasyprint is an awesome plugin for [dokku][dokku] that properly installs the weasyprint into the docker instance.
This plugin should fix the problems you may have when downloading weasyprint with ```apt-get``` for example by using another awesome plugin [dokku-apt][dokku-apt].

## Installation

On your dokku server:
```sh
# On 0.3.x
git clone https://github.com/backstitch/dokku-weasyprint /var/lib/dokku/plugins/dokku-weasyprint

# On 0.4.x
dokku plugin:install https://github.com/backstitch/dokku-weasyprint.git weasyprint
```

All future deployments will have dokku-weasyprint installed.
